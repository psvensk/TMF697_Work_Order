# TMF697_Work_Order
A Work Order is an arrangement to do something at a particular time and place. It may be necessary to solve a customer problem or to deliver a product order item. The Work Order API's goal is to manage a Work Order with all the necessary characteristics.

The Work Order API performs the following operations on a workOrder resource:

      Retrieval of a workOrder or a collection of workOrder depending on filter criteria

      Partial update of a workOrder (including updating rules)

      Creation of a workOrder (including default values and creation rules)

      Deletion of a workOrder (for administration purposes)

      Notification of events on a workOrder
